What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	You can pick files which you want to check and possibly commit one by one,
	while they are in the staging area it is very easy to check for differences
	between them and most recent commit by using git diff -staged, when you are
	sure that you have added the files which would make one logical change you
	can commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Well, there were examples given such as when trying an experimental feature
	or when wanting to label a certain commit as a working version. They would
	help by providing the possibility to easily navigate through these dedicated
	commits and keeping the commit history easily trackable.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Having a diagram helps to see how branches are related to each other e. i.
	which commit was the last common commit for both branches, also, it helps
	identifying unreachable commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	When we merget two branches together we create a new commit which has several
	parent commits - each tip of merged branches, thus it makes sense to draw the
	diagrama in a way that represents this multi-parented commit. Also it is worth 
	noting that the merge commit's and all its following commits' "git log" will
	represent commits of merged branches in chronological order e. i. they will be
	interleaved.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Automatic merging is more efficient as it saves time, but it's not 100% of the
	time correct, meanwhile manual merging is made implicitly be a person, thus it
	is more reliable, but it comes with a decrese in efficiency as it requires time
	to inspect all the changes and choose them manually.
