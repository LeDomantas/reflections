When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When my project needs to be accessed remotely e.g. when collaborating with 
    several people, when developing an open source product, when deploying
    changes remotely, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For serveral reasons: specifying the branch you want to pull, minimizing 
    the infrastructure load, organizing your work in a logical manner.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks and clones are instances/copies of a repository, meanwhile branches are
    labels on commits, that gets passed over to child commits. Forks are GitHub's
    concept, meanwhile, clones and branches are git's concept. You would use forks
    when you want to indroduce changes to GitHub's repository without affecting
    the original repository, clones when you want to do the same but not necessarily
    on GitHub and branches whenever you want to introduce new feature, bug fix or
    else and you do not want to introduce these changes into the working copy yet.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
